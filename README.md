# Research-A2-highway-Netherlands
A study and stochastic simulation of the traffic jams on A2 highway, Netherlands

Traffic jams are getting more frequent every day as the number of cars on Dutch motorways grows.  In order to acquire a better understanding of the economic impact of lost hours from drivers delayed in traffic jams, a research was done on the dataset given by Rijkswaterstaat. The dataset includes 26 columns providing information on each traffic jam on the Dutch motorway network, from January 1, 2015.  For the purpose of this study the data from September, 2016 and A2 highway was chosen.  A2 highway is one of the most heavily traveled roads in the Netherlands. The route connects the Belgian A25 road and the city of Amsterdam, near the Amstel interchange, with the Belgian border, near Maastricht (NL) andLi√®ge. The purpose of this study is finding out the main causes and frequency of traffic jams in order to give solutions for improving the current situation.
