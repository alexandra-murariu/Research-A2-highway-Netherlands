A study and stochastic simulation of the traffic jams on A2 highway, Netherlands
Traffic jams are getting more frequent every day as the number of cars on Dutch motorways grows.  Inorder to acquire a better understanding of the economic impact of lost hours from drivers delayed in traf-fic jams, a research was done on the dataset given by Rijkswaterstaat.
